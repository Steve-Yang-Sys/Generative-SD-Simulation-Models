# Generative-SD-Simulation-Models
This repository contains Python code to transform textual outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini into standard XMILE model file that can be directly open on most System Dynamics (SD) software tools. It encompasses two parts: 1. directly talk with LLMs on the website and export JSON data file manually; 2. use API call.
